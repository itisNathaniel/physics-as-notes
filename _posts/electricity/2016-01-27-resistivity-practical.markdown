**Determine resistivity**

* Finding the resistance using a test wire (of the material you want to know the resistivity of
* Can then use the resistnace and wire dimensions to calculate the resisitivity using:

\\[ ρ =\dfrac {RA}{L} \\]
*Where ρ = Resistivity (Ωm), R = Resistance (Ω), A = CSA (m), L = Length (m)*

1. Calculate the wire's cross sectional area:
	* Measure diameter in 3 different places using micrometer
	* Find mean diameter and half it to get radius (and convert value into metres)
	* Sub into: a = πr^2 to get cross-sectional area 
2. Measure the resistivity using the following set up:

*How to set up circuit*

* Attach flying lead to end of test wire and measure length of test wire attached to circuit
* Close switch and measure p.d across test wire and current through circuit
* Open switch and record results
* Repeat again and record results for same length and take mean
* Reposition flying lead to get average at different lengths
* Plot a graph of resistance/length and draw on line of best fit
* As gradient of line = R/L rearranging resistivity equation gives:
\\[ \dfrac {ρ}{A} =\dfrac {R}{L} \\]

* Can now sub in known values to get resistivity, so just multiply gradient by cross sectional area (in metres squared)

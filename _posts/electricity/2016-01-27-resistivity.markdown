categories: electricity

**Resistivity**

* How difficult it is for a current to flow through a material
* Lower resistivity means a better conductor
* For example, for a wire it depends on:
	* *Length (L)* as longer wire means it's more dorrocult to make current flow through, resistance is proportional to wire length
	* *Area (A)* as wider wire means easier for electrons to pass along
	* *Resistivity (ρ)* is a measurement of how much the material is resisting the flow of current. It depends on structure of material and environmental factors (temperature and light intensity)


\\[ ρ =\dfrac {RA}{L} \\]
*Where ρ = Resistivity (Ωm), R = Resistance (Ω), A = CSA (m), L = Length (m)*

	Q: Metal has length 0.50cm, square CSA (width 11cm) and 
	resistance 1.22x10-8Ω, find resistivity:
	A: ρ = RA/L --> ρ= 1.22x10^-8x(0.11x0.11)/0.005 --> 2.9 x 10^-9Ωm

	Q: Toaster's heating element is bare nichrome wire with radius 0.02mm 
	and 0.8m length. Find wire's resistance (Nicrome ρ=1.10x10-6Ωm)
	A: R = PL/A --> R=(1.10x10^-6 x 0.8)/(π(0.002^2) --> 7.009 --> 7Ω

**Semiconductors**

* Group of materials that aren't as good at conducting as metals due to having fewer charge carriers (electrons) available
* If energy is supplied to the semiconductor (i.e by increasing the temperature) so more charge carriers are released and the resistivity decreases
* Make good sensors for detecting changes
* Three of the most common semiconductors are thermistors, light-dependant resistors and diodes.

**Thermistor - a semiconductor:**

* Thermistors resistance depends on the surrounding temperature
* In NTC resistor the resistance decreases as the temperature increases
* The thermistor being warmed gives electrons enough energy to escape from atoms so the resistance is lower
* Useful as temperature sensors

*Resistance/Temperature graph for NTC thermistor*

**To investigate their resistance:**

1. Put thermistor in beaker (connected to ammeter)
2. Pour boiling water into beaker (enough to cover thermistor) and record the temperature of the water and the current though the circuit
3. Every 5°C the water drops record the current, do this for at least 8 measurements
4. Plot an Resistance/Temperature graph and the pattern above should be shown

**Superconductors:**

* Most materials have some resistivity (even copper) but means that some energy is always lost as heat
* Superconductors stop this, if the material has its temperature lowered below the transitional temperature their resistivity disappears entirely and become superconductor
* With no resistance no electricital energy becomes heat so none wasted
* However most transitional temperatures below -273°C so very expensive to cool that low
* Scientists currently working to increase this temperature

**Uses:**

* Power cables to transmit energy without any loss
* Strong electromagnets (for maglev trains)
* Electronic circuits with very little energy loss

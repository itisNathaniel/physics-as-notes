**Resistance**

* If potential difference put across component, current will flow
* How much current dependant on dependent on resistance of the component
* Resistance of component is how difficult to get current to flow
* Measured in Ohms (Ω)
* 1Ω means 1V makes 1A flow through
* Equation:

\\[ R =\dfrac {V}{I} \\]
*Where R = Resistance (Ω), V = P.D (V), I = Current (A)*

	Q: P.D across a component 230V, current is 12.4A;
	   calculate component resistance 
	A: 230/12.4 = 18.6Ω (19Ω)

	Q: Resistor resistance of 4.43Ω and p.d of 12V. Calculate current
	A: I = V/R --> I= 12/4.43 --> I=2.7A

**Ohmic Conductors**

* Rule to predict how current changes as potential difference changes for certain conductors (called Ohmic conductors)
* Rule called Ohm's Law
* States that providing that temperature and other conditions remain constant, the current through an Ohmic conductor is directly proportional to p.d across it.

*Ohmic Conductor I/P.D graph*

* Resistance can however be affected by light level or temperature, so Ohm's is only appliable to certain conductors under certain conditions 
* Many components aren't Ohmic and have very different I-V graphs

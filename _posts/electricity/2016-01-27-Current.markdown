title:  2. Charge, Current and Potential Difference

categories: electricity
---
**Charge:**

* Electrical circuit charge is carried through wires by electrons (called charge carriers)
* The units of charge are Colomb (C)
* One colomb is the amount of charge passing through the circuit in 1 second when the current is 1 amp
* Conserved quantity, cannot be created nor destroyed

\\[ \Delta Q = I\Delta T  \\]
*Where Q = Charge (Coulomb), I = Current (Amps), T = Time (Seconds)*

	Q: How much charge passes a point when 20mA flows for 1 hour?
	A: (20x10-3)x60(60) = 72 C
	
	Q: If electron carries -1.6x10-19C, how many pass per second 
	when current is 1A?
	A: -1.6x10^-19C = 1A x 1  ---> 1/1.6x10-19C ---> 6.25x10^18 Electrons

**Current**

* Current is the rate of flow of charge
* Represented by 'I' in equations
* Scalar quantity and unit Ampere (or amp/A)

\\[ I =\dfrac {\Delta Q}  {\Delta T}\\]

	Q: What current flows when a charge of 100C passes point in 20 seconds?
	A: 100/20 = 5A

**Potential Difference**

* The energy needed to be tranferred to the charge to make it flow through the circuit
* Also known as p.d and V (in equations)
* This is supplied by the power source (such as a battery)
* When the charge flows through it's 'raised' through a potential and charge is transferred as electrical potential energy
* When energy transferred 'work is done', so power source does work to move charge around circuit
* Potential difference or volage between two points is the work done moving unit charge between these points
* Higher p.d means charge moves faster so more energy transferred
* Charge of one coulomb pasing through a p.d of one volt is one joule of work done
\\[ V =\dfrac {\Delta W}  {\Delta T}\\ or \\ W = QV \\]
*Where W = Work Done*

	Q: 2C charge moved through 160V pd in electric motor. 
	How much energy transferred from energy supply to the motor?
	A: W=QV --> W=2x160 --> W=320J

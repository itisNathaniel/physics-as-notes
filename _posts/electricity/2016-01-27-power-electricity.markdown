**Power**

* The rate of transfer of energy
* Measured in Watts (W); 1W means 1 joule of energy transferred per second
\\[ P =\dfrac {E}{t} \\    or    \\ P = IV \\]
*Where P = power (W), E = Energy (J), T = Time (s), I = Current (A), V = p.d (V)*

* Equations for calculating power to be derived from:
\\[ I =\dfrac {P}{V} \\    and    \\ V = IR \\]
*to give:*
\\[ P =\dfrac {V^2}{R} \\    and    \\ P = I^2R \\]

	Q: 24W headlamp connected to 12V battery, assuming the wires have 
	negligible resistance:
	1) How much energy converted into light 2 hours. 2) Lamp resistance
	
	A: 
	1. 60x60x2 = 7200 seconds. P=E/T, E=PT, E=24x7200, E=172,800, E=172kJ
	2. V=IR --> R=V/I --> R=12/I --> I=24/12 I=2A --> R=12/2 --> R=6Î©

**Energy**

* If looking for the total energy transferred, substitute P=E/T into power equations to get the following energy equations

\\[ E = IVt \\ and \\ E =\dfrac {V^2}{R}t \\] *also* \\[E = I^2Rt\\]

	Q: Takes 4.5 minutes for kettle to boil, 4.0A current flows through the 
	heating element when connected to 230V mains.
	1) calculate kettle power. 2) calculate energy for heat to boil
	
	A:
	1. P=IV --> P=4x230 --> P=920W
	2. E=920(4.5x60) --> E=248,400J --> 250kJ

title:  4. I-V Characteristics

categories: electricity
---
**What are they**

* I-V characteristics are graphs which show how current flowing through component changes as P.D increases
* Smaller gradient of I-V graph means means grater resistance
* If curve means that the resistance is changing

*Ohmic Conductor I/V Graph for ohmic conductors*

**Finding IV Characteristics**

*Equipment set-up for testing I-V characteristics*

* Connect the equipment above, replacing the filament lamp in the diagram with any other component to be tested
* Change voltage against the component tested and record the current
* Plot an I-V graph of the component by recording a range of current and voltage values

---
**Ideal Voltmeters and Ammeters**

* Assume in experiments that voltmeters and ammeters used are ideal 
* Means voltmeters assumed to have infinite resistance (so no current flows) and ammeters have no resistance (so no p.d across them)

**Ohmic Conductors**

*Ohmic Conductor I-V graph*

* Current through Ohmic conductor directly proportional to voltage
* Means that resistance doesn't change
* Metals often are Ohmic Conductors

**Filament lamp**

*Filament Lamp I-V graph*

* Curve that starts steep but becomes shallower as p.d rises
* Filament is a thin coil of metal wire, not the same characteristic as a metal as electrical energy transferred into heat
* Heat causes particles to vibrate more; means more difficult for charge carrying electrons to get through so current can't flow as easily and the resistance increases
* Resistors have a limit as to amount of current that can flow though and more current means a temperature and resistance increase so the current decreases again causing the levelling off at high current

**Diodes**

*Diode I-V graph*

* Diodes such as LEDs made from semiconductors
* Designed to allow current in only one direction
* Current only allowed to flow in *forward bias* direction
* Most diodes require about 0.6V in forward directon to start conducting, called the threshold voltage
* In *reverse bias* (the opposite direction) resistance very high and current very small
* On the diagram above, the threshold is when the the current increases from zero.
